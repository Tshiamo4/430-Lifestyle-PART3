## CSS Styling
The `css/style.css` file is a modern stylesheet that applies consistent styling across all HTML pages. It enhances the website's design by providing a cohesive look and feel. The stylesheet includes styles for:

- **Body**: Sets the overall font, background color, and text color for readability.
- **Headers**: Defines styles for headings to ensure they stand out.
- **Navigation**: Styles the navigation menu for a user-friendly experience.
- **Sections**: Provides spacing and layout for different sections of the pages.
- **Footer**: Ensures the footer is visually appealing and consistent across all pages.

### Modifying the Stylesheet
To modify the stylesheet for future updates, open the `css/style.css` file and make changes to the existing styles or add new styles as needed. Ensure to test the website after making changes to maintain a consistent design.

## HTML Files
Each HTML file links to the `style.css` file to apply the styles consistently. To link the stylesheet, add the following line within the `<head>` section of each HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```

This ensures that all pages reflect the same styling, enhancing the overall user experience.
